So, what the hell, Paul?
------------------------

Hey there! Since my blog is actually, well, a blog, I figured I needed somewhere
to jot notes with a bit higher signal / noise ratio. [fib.io](http://fib.io/)
is my own little notebook, a place to keep the hacks I've picked up in one
place.

This site is my own version of the (outstanding) book "UNIX Power Tools",
a desktop ref for all things hackish.

Sitting down and reading through all these bad ideas may in fact cause brain
damnage, so don't worry about doing that.
