Summary: KDE vs GNOME

This is NOT my response to the oh-so-dull and typical flame-wars regarding
whether the GNOME or KDE desktop is "best". I have an opinion on that,
but that's not what this is about. This is about how I picture the
development process of each of those fine desktop products.

Warning to readers: this is mildly offensive, however it's not
particularly obscene, for most values of obscene. On a flame-o-riffic
scale of one to ten, it rates about a seventy-three.

When I contemplate how the GNOME and KDE desktops are developed, here
is what I imagine:

KDE
---

A big room somewhere in Europe with lots of chrome and glass and a great
big whiteboard in the front with lots of tiny, neat writing on it. There
are about 50 desks, each with headphones and pristine workstations,
also with a lot of chrome and glass. The faint sound of classical music
permeates the room, accompanying the clicky-click of 50 programmers
typing or quietly talking in one of the appropriately assigned meeting
areas. (Which of course consist of elegant contemporary white pine coffee
tables surrounded by contemporary white pine and fine leather meeting
chairs.) Coffee, tea, mineral water and fruit juices are available in
the break area.

At the end of the day, *everyone* checks in their code and the project
leader does a "make" just to make sure it all compiles cleanly, but
it's mostly only done from tradition anymore since it always compiles
cleanly and works flawlessly. When all milestones have been met, and
everything has been QA'd, (usually within a day or two of the roadmap
that was written up 18 months previous) a new KDE release is packaged
up and released to the mirror sites with the appropriate 24-hour delay
for distribution before being announced.

KDE developers are generally between the ages of 16 and 25, like art
made of lines and squares and the colors white and black. When/if they
finally stop taking government subsidies and get around to getting "real
jobs," most of their salary will be taken in taxes so the socialist
government can subsidize the care and feeding of the next generation
of KDE developers, just like it did for them. A high percentage of KDE
developers, during their mandatory 5 years of government military service,
crack from their years of cultural dullness and flee Europe to become
terrorists for the sheer joy to be found in killing random strangers
for no discernible reason.

GNOME
-----

An abandoned warehouse in San Francisco, kitted up as for a rave,
electronica playing at 15db louder than "my ears are bleeding and
I'm developing an aneurism" volumes and the windows all painted
over black so that the strobe and spotlights and lasers can be seen
better. Computers, mainly made of whatever stuff has been exchanged for
crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs, are scattered around
on whatever furniture is available, which also consists of whatever
stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind
dot-bombs. There's no break area, but you may be able to bum a beer
(or more likely something harder) off of one of the developers hanging
around, and they will probably be too jacked up on X, coke, acid, heroin,
ether or all of the above to notice that you've taken anything.

Development strategies are generally determined by whatever light show
happens to be going on at the moment, when one of the developers will leap
up and scream "I WANT IT TO LOOK JUST LIKE THAT" and then straight-arm
his laptop against the wall in an hallucinogenic frenzy before vomiting
copiously, passing out and falling face-down in the middle of the dance
floor. There's no whiteboard, so developers diagram things out in the
puddles of spilt beer, urine and vomit on the floor.

At the end of the day - whenever that is since an equal number of
programmers will be passed out at any given time - or really whenever
someone happens to think of it (which is rarely), someone might type
"make" on some machine somewhere, with mixed results. Generally nothing
happens, so he/she shrugs his/her shoulders and wanders off to look for
someone who might have more pink/black-striped pills. Once in a great
while, generally in the unpleasant time between the come-down from the
last thing they took and before whatever it was they took just now comes
on fully, someone will tar up a bunch of random files and post it on a
website someplace it as the next GNOME release, usually with a reference
to some kind of monkey.

GNOME developers rarely live past 25 and prefer "alternative" art -
generally stuff made of feces that's "too edgy" for most people to
"understand" or "like." Core GNOME developers are heavy Ketamine
users. The bodies of GNOME developers can often be found in dumpsters
or floating face-down in any sufficiently large body of water.
